# Motivation

This project is an attempt to make accurate minute of angle
(MOA) sized targets that you can display on a 1080p TV in
order to conduct dry fire practice for precision rifle.

# Usage

The first step is to determine how many pixels one
milliradian (mil) subtends in your reticle when you look at
your display through it. Line your reticle up with one of
the squares that descends from the upper left corner of the
screen and count its position from the first square. They go
in order of 1 pixel, 2px, 3px, and so on. Once you find the
square that most closely matches 1 mil in your scope, you
can use the gif that matches that number. For example, if
one mil in your reticle subtends 7 pixels, then use 07.gif.

Now the squares in the middle of the screen are moa accurate
from 0.5, increasing in size by 0.5 (the next larger target
is 1.0 moa, the one above that is 1.5 moa and so on).
